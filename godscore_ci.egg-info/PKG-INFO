# GodScore CI

**Survivability-Aware Continuous Integration Gate**

GodScore CI is a GitHub Action that introduces a new class of CI gate:
**long-term system survivability**.

Traditional CI answers:
- Does it compile?
- Do tests pass?
- Is performance acceptable?

GodScore CI asks a harder question:

> **Does this change reduce the system’s ability to survive, self-correct, or recover over time?**

If survivability drops below policy, the gate reacts.

---

## What GodScore CI Enforces

GodScore CI evaluates a single scalar metric — the **God Variable (Gv)** — representing:

- Survivability
- Correctability
- Irreversibility risk

The gate evaluates:
- **Absolute survivability thresholds**
- **Negative survivability trends (regression over time)**

This prevents slow, silent degradation that traditional CI cannot detect.

---

## Free vs Pro Modes

GodScore CI supports two execution modes designed to balance accessibility with enforcement.

### 🆓 Free Mode (Default)

- No token required
- Detects survivability regression
- Emits warnings only
- CI continues

Free mode answers:
> *“Is survivability getting worse?”*

It is ideal for:
- Early visibility
- Experimentation
- Research and development

---

### 🔒 Pro Mode (Enforced)

- Requires a Pro token
- Detects survivability regression
- **Fails CI when regression exceeds policy**

Pro mode answers:
> *“Should this change be allowed to ship?”*

It is intended for:
- Production pipelines
- Release enforcement
- High-risk systems

---

## Survivability Regression Policy

GodScore CI does not only evaluate absolute survivability — it also detects **negative trends over time**.

A regression occurs when the current Gv score drops significantly below recent historical performance.
Free mode surfaces regressions early; Pro mode enforces them at the gate.

### Regression Handling by Mode

| Mode | Regression Detected | CI Result |
|-----|--------------------|----------|
| Free | Yes | ⚠️ Warning only |
| Pro  | Yes | ❌ Build fails |

This design allows teams to see survivability decay early, while reserving enforcement for production pipelines.

## Usage Examples

### Free Mode (Warn Only)

```yaml
- uses: willshacklett/godscore-ci@v1
  with:
    score: 0.81
    mode: free

- uses: willshacklett/godscore-ci@v1
  with:
    score: 0.81
    mode: pro
    pro_token: ${{ secrets.GV_PRO_TOKEN }}
