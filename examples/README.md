# GodScore CI Examples

This folder contains minimal examples showing how GodScore CI behaves.

## Files

- `passes.yml`  
  A workflow configuration that **passes** the survivability gate.

- `fails.yml`  
  A workflow configuration that **fails** when survivability drops below the threshold.

## Why this exists

These examples are intentionally simple so you can:
- Copy/paste into your own repo
- Fork and tweak values
- See CI fail *before* irreversible system drift sneaks in
