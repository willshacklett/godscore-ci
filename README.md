# GodScore CI

**GodScore CI** is an experimental continuous integration (CI) framework that extends traditional software testing beyond correctness and performance.

It introduces an additional evaluative dimension — the **God Variable (Gv)** — designed to penalize behaviors that undermine long-term system survivability, corrigibility, and ethical coherence.

## Why GodScore CI Exists

Modern CI pipelines answer questions like:
- Does the code run?
- Is it fast?
- Does it pass tests?

GodScore CI asks deeper questions:
- Does this system suppress its own ability to be corrected?
- Does optimization create irreversible harm?
- Does short-term success compromise long-term survivability?

If the answer is yes, the **God Variable score decreases**.

## The God Variable (Gv)

The God Variable is **not a moral authority** and **not a claim of truth**.

It is a **filter**:
- Penalizes irreversible actions
- Penalizes suppression of error correction
- Penalizes unfalsifiable moral certainty
- Rewards openness, reversibility, and long-term coherence

The goal is not to define “good” —  
the goal is to **preserve the conditions under which correction remains possible indefinitely**.

## What This Repository Contains

- A minimal, test-driven baseline implementation of the God Variable
- CI workflows that evaluate invariants, perturbations, and failure modes
- Experimental extensions exploring learning, feedback, and survivability metrics

This repository is intentionally explicit, modular, and auditable.

## What This Is Not

- ❌ A religious claim  
- ❌ A political framework  
- ❌ A final moral system  

GodScore CI is an **engineering experiment**.

## Status

⚠️ This project is experimental and under active development.

The framework is intended to evolve through testing, critique, and real-world use.
