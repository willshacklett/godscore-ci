# GodScore CI

![CI](https://github.com/willshacklett/godscore-ci/actions/workflows/godscore-ci.yml/badge.svg)

GodScore CI is an experimental continuous-integration framework for evaluating
systems not only on correctness and performance, but on **long-term coherence,
auditability, and harm avoidance**.

## Core Idea

GodScore introduces a scoring layer intended to penalize:
- irreversible harm,
- suppression of correction or dissent,
- moral certainty without falsifiability,
- optimization paths that collapse long-term system survivability.

The goal is not to define truth, ideology, or authority, but to preserve the
conditions under which intelligent systems can continue to correct themselves.

## Non-Claim

This project does **not** assert moral superiority, religious authority, or
political alignment. Any use of GodScore to justify coercion, irreversibility,
or centralized power contradicts its purpose.

## Status

This repository currently focuses on CI workflows and test scaffolding.
The objective logic and scoring mechanisms are intentionally modular and auditable.
